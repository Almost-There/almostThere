<h1>Almost-There.org</h1>
The purpose of this website was to connect gamers together from across many games while balancing a social community, discussion board, and other projects.

In 2022 a plan is made for this website to be re-coded and maintained for  'legacy purposes' and if any traction or intrest comes of it may try an attempt at reincorporation and reunion.

Almost-There had an incredible community with amazing flair and inginuity unseen before and was an intregal part of our lives.
